                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">
                                        Instrument pointing control systems mounted on spacecraft are inherently bandwidth-limited due to lightly-damped flexible modes of the spacecraft. This talk is concerned with the recovery of control bandwidth for space-based pointing systems via the application of mu-tip control. This talk will first review the equations of motion of
                                        a flexible spacecraft. Next, using a "massive payload assumption" a passive input-output map is established between a modified output, called the mu-tip rate, and a modified control input. This
                                        introduction of the mu-tip rate and modified control input enables the use of passivity-based control, which in turn realized robust closed-loop control to mass and stiffness uncertainty. Bandwidth recovery is confirmed by investigating the frequency response of the linearized system.

To obtain such a catalog is not an easy task: it requires years of planning and observations using observatories across the continent, as well as meticulous image processing and data analysis with state-of-the-art models. In this presentation, we discover what are those stellar remnants that we call white dwarfs, what they can teach us about astronomy and physics and why finding them represents such a challenge.</p>

It is being developed by Université Laval, along with numerous collaborators, and will be launched under the CSA’s STRATOS program in August of 2018 from Timmins, Ontario. The “big picture” goal of this project is to characterize the atmosphere and validate the instruments, techniques and concepts used so that they can be employed for future exoplanet-studying missions.</p>

                                        In the past, the pace of development on Earth and now increasingly in the outer space is beyond comprehension and introspection of the collective global human society. Recently, as we entered the epoch of Anthropocene we have learnt, that over the time the humankind in itself has become a collective geophysical force acting against the nature resulting into crossing of crucial tipping points, endangering its survival on the only habitable planet, Earth.<br>
                                        As we venture out into outer space, with feasible plans of resource mining, terraforming and space colonization, fundamental questions arise, pertaining to what kind of precedents do we set for the future. Do we rely and act on the same socio-political paradigm of the Earth, where race for resources led to colonization, industrial revolution followed by globalization to surface an unjust, unequal and most importantly, environmentally unsustainable global society. Or do we re-think the whole socio-political and developmental paradigm, thinking profoundly for the first time a non-anthropocentric value system giving intrinsic value to the nature and the cosmos.<br>
                                        Against this backdrop, I challenge the “human as dominant specie” value system and argue (in light of space exploration and exploitation) a crucial reset of socio-political, developmental and environmental paradigm to make a case for “Before Scientists, Space needs Social Scientists”.

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">The International Space Station (ISS) is an enormous achievement in terms of international collaboration and engineering. The assembly took more than 12 years, starting in 1998, and the station was gradually expanded with habitats, research facilities, life support systems, and other infrastructures that were built all around the world. The ISS Program is set to end in 2024, yet still has the potential to keep working through 2028 and beyond. The international partners must decide if they want to continue the program and establish a new vision. This discussion proposes an extension of life meant to inspire the next generations, develop innovative technologies, and enable ground-breaking research for humankind. To achieve these goals, we assumed a future where the economic and technological trends that we are seeing today keep unfolding. With this assumption in mind, we proposed to split the ISS into two independent space stations, and repurpose them respectively into an International Research Facility and an International Spaceport. The International Research Facility will take over the research activities of the ISS, and create new research opportunities thanks to additional modules. In the future, the International Research Facility will be equipped with training facilities for the next generation of space explorers. The International Spaceport will provide docking ports and manufacturing facilities to assemble, service, repair, and refuel spacecraft for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The technological aspects of this endeavor, the political requirements, and the financial viability were examined. While our research was specifically focused in finding an alternative to decommissioning the ISS, the question of whether de-orbiting is the best solution to the end of life of the ISS still remains. We believe that there are other options, and that keeping a permanent human presence in orbit is of paramount importance. The end of the ISS would likely represent a major setback to human space exploration and international collaboration. With a large variety of valid alternatives to decommissioning, we hope this topic will inspire decision makers to move towards a better future for the ISS.</p>

                                        The Canadian Space Agency’s (CSA) planetary exploration program involves participation in a variety of ongoing missions and a series of preparatory activities for those yet to come. CSA’s planetary science goals follow two broad themes: (i) understanding the origin and evolution of the solar system, and (ii) habitability and life detection.<br>
                                        Two Canadian scientific instruments are currently in operation: the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) aboard the Mars Science Laboratory’s (MSL) Curiosity Rover, and the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA), presently cruising towards asteroid Bennu. Additionally, Canadian scientists are contributing expertise via Participating Scientist / Co-Investigator roles on MSL, NASA’s Mars InSight, and the ESA/Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).<br>
                                        Moving forward, agencies throughout the world are evaluating how to return samples from Mars, are considering a return to the Moon, and are developing mission concepts to explore the moons of the outer planets for possible signs of life. Canada continues to work with its international partners to identify possibilities to make important contributions to these efforts.

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">One of the goals of space law is to secure the use of outer space for the advancement of humankind. At the same time, technological developments towards space mining reveal that such endeavor can only be realized with the active participation of the private sector that would inevitably require either the a priori permissibility of commercial exploitation of space resources, or the a posteriori acceptance of it. However, one controversial question arises: How would it be possible to continue securing the use of outer space towards the advancement of humankind when the commercialization of substantive parts of the latter seems legally blocked due to the very nature of space law that prohibits appropriation of outer space parts. Such a question is directly linked to the issue of whether the time for New Laws as envisioned by New Space activities has arrived. This paper attempts to present the current legal framework that surrounds the exploitation of celestial bodies' natural resources and answer the afforementioned question on the basis of benefit-sharing mechanisms. Specifically, it asks whether benefit-sharing agreements would legitimize the exploitation/commercialization of space natural resources, and if so, how would this be legally feasible.</p>

                                        The space sector is currently undergoing one the most dynamic periods of all times. Over the last years new commercial actors have emerged introducing innovative concepts from manufacturing to services, largely based on low-cost smallsat constellations. They have the value proposition of bringing the cost down of solutions, making space more affordable and accessible to end-users. With disruptive changes in the market and technological environment, the commercial space sector faces now unique challenges but also tremendous opportunities introduced by these new actors.<br>
                                        The proposed presentation will provide an overview of the smallsat market. This will include an overview of the number of satellites launched, main programs, applications targeted by these new solutions (e.g.: global connectivity (Satcom), high-frequency change detection (Earth Observation)), as well as what are the disrupting changes that these new smallsat solutions are introducing across the value chain.

However, our capacity to utilize space is very limited due to our singular method of space travel: rockets. Some decades from now a more sustainable and elegant transit system to space, known as a Space Elevator, may be established. The scope of such a project is immense and requires a tremendous amount of research and planning. This talk will describe the space elevator, explore some of its challenges, and focus on research that is currently underway.</p>

                                        An important aspect of national space programs is their ability to provide technological spin-offs that will benefit human earthly pursuits. Neptec will present two current projects that illustrate the potential Space technology has for benefiting humanity in a very direct way.<br>
                                        Through a 13 year development program undertaken in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), Neptec has developed a substantial expertise in laser-based machine vision. The latest iteration of this LiDAR work, the mini-LiDAR or mLDR, is of a size that supports integration to autonomous vehicles, specifically cars. This miniature sensor will help accelerate what is an already very fast moving technology for self-driving cars. In 2013, Neptec led an industry-academia consortium in the definition of an astronaut healthcare concept for exploration class missions. The CSA called the concept the Advanced Crew Medical System (ACMS). Since 2013, Neptec and its partners have pursued the development of the ACMS through work for the CSA and ESA (European Space Agency) as well as healthcare institutions such as St. Mary’s Hospital Foundation in Montreal. The terrestrial version of the ACMS, called the Autonomous Medical System (AMS), offers the potential to revolutionize healthcare in the 21st century by:

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">
                                        Humanity today faces a grave number of space-based threats, both cosmological and anthropological: some threaten our way of life while others threaten our very lives. Surmounting these perils will require the concentrated and coordinated effort of all States, channelled towards the betterment of humanity. The manner in which we have attempted to address these threats to-date has been stifled by the isolationist structure of national space agencies and the inability to overcome longstanding political and legal obstacles. This presentation will investigate whether the creation of a global, international Terran Space Agency (tasked with solving six particular projects to safeguard human existence and improve the human condition) can be a method by which to overcome the legal barriers currently impeding progress. In particular, it will examine the value of a Terran Space Agency on the basis of whether it honours the equitable foundations of international space law.<br>
                                        This presentation will use as examples six current global space issues and demonstrate that the present shortcomings in solving these challenges are neither technological nor motivational but, in fact, legal and political. It will then investigate whether a Terran Space Agency (TESA) could provide a solution, within the existing legal framework, through which to address and solve the current problems. The significant challenges include: 1) remediating space debris; 2) undertaking space situational awareness and space traffic management; 3) preparing for and administering planetary protection; 4) exploiting the vast resources of outer space; 5) exploring and settling diverse planetary systems; and 6) searching for, understanding and communicating with extraterrestrial life forms. The presentation will use these examples to investigate whether a new international organization can tackle these and future issues appropriately.

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">Students at the post-secondary level enter Introductory Astronomy courses with varied backgrounds, from no prior exposure (aside from Primary and Secondary curriculum) or backyard astronomers to budding Astrophysicists and Aerospace Engineers. The role of these courses is to share basic information, skills and possibilities (scientifically and career-wise), so that students who have an affinity for space sciences have a starting point to leap onto a career path. Traditional approaches use a historical evolution of information with relatively static learning outcomes. In the digital and social media age, most students have some exposure to recent discoveries, and more importantly they have access to information and current data that better represents the direction of space science they will experience. I will describe a novel approach that puts the direction and depth of the content covered into the students' control.</p>

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">The design of any complex system requires the use of a multitude of specialized tools in parallel while having to maintain an overall conflict-free and consistent design. This is a difficult requirement that can be very time consuming. One solution is to integrate the various tools such that there is only one master source for each piece of information. We demonstrate this approach for the particular problem of spacecraft design where the following tools are integrated: Satellite ToolKit from AGI (for orbital mechanics, etc). , NX (for Mechanical design) and Modelica as the main workhorse for all the dynamics.</p>

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">
                                        Albert Einstein's greatest achievement is the general theory of relativity -- the modern view of gravitation -- and the confirmed predictions that arise from it. Such predictions include time warps, the bending of light, and black holes! The most elusive and intriguing prediction, however, is the existence of gravitational waves (GWs), which are periodic ripples of space and time. Until last year, we could only "see" gravitational waves indirectly by observing the decaying orbits of "radio pulsars", which are the remnant corpses of supernova explosions.<br>
                                        The era of GW astronomy has finally begun, with last year's announcement of a direct GW detection using the ground-based LIGO instrument. Various instruments are now being built to observe these waves, from the ground and in space. I will talk about how radio pulsars serve as a natural GW "detector", and will be crucial for observing GWs from the inspiral of supermassive black holes in the distant Universe.

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">
                                        Canada has a strong national strategic interest in space. Space will be used as a way to drive a broader economic growth and leveraged for the benefits of Canadians. Canada’s future in space relies on innovation, advancement of science and technology, and future generation of highly educated and skilled space scientists and engineers. A strong Canadian space capability demonstration program is needed for maintaining Canada’s leading edge in space and developing new capabilities for the future. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA), in response to the needs expressed by Canadian space industry, academia, and the government, and to better prepare Canada to capture future mission and commercial opportunities, is in the process of developing a capability demonstration program, which includes both pre-space demonstration and space demonstration. Demonstration in space on board a satellite or a space platform (e.g. ISS) is the most desirable method to demonstrate new technology, scientific approach or capability. However, there are only a limited number of opportunities for space demonstration flights and the associated cost is usually high. Suborbital platforms, such as balloons and rockets, remain popular for the academia and industry engaging in space science and engineering to test their hardware and approaches as they provide near-space environments with low cost and easy access. Suborbital platforms are also often used to conduct science in Canada’s priority areas such as study of climate changes and validation of satellite data (ex. atmospheric data).<br>
                                        This paper discusses the needs for a capability demonstration program and its overall objectives, and provides greater details on demonstration activities using suborbital platforms, including on-going stratospheric balloon flights, parabolic flights, and possible rocket flights in the future for Canada.

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">As we mark six decades of space operations, the number of objects in Earth orbit continues to rise, reaching well over 20,000 tracked objects. A much larger number of objects, estimated to be several hundred thousand, too small to be tracked, also clutter the space environment. The objects are an accumulation of active and inactive satellites, rocket bodies and debris associated with launches, satellite failures and ASAT testing. Increased commercialization of space is resulting in ever-greater numbers of satellites orbited every year. The recent plans for mega-constellations of several thousand satellites are an alarming development. Technology is enabling greater utilization of space, but there is no international regulatory mechanism to mange the environment. The UNCOPUOS space debris mitigation guidelines are non-binding leading to insufficient compliance. Unless trends change, some of the more useful orbital regimes risk becoming unsustainable due increasing congestion and debris.</p>

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">Rovers have dramatically increased our ability to explore Mars, and there is a growing body of work in rover field testing done in analogue environments here on Earth to aid rover designers, planners, and operators. A key Martian attribute that cannot be replicated in field trials on Earth, though, is the effect of reduced gravity on the soil itself. Soil in reduced gravity has reduced strength which poses a mobility challenge. This lecture outlines some of the physical effects of reduced gravity on soils, and describes our research lab’s upcoming experimentation campaign to test rover wheel-soil interactions in reduced-gravity flights aboard the National Research Council’s Falcon 20 aircraft.</p>

Two clear issues arose: a lack of resources to maintain our legacy of excellence in space exploration and a lack of process for choosing where to invest those resources. In response to this and in consultation with stakeholders from science and industry, we developed a white paper articulating a vision for Canadian space exploration. I'll summarize the key points of the white paper and talk about our subsequent efforts to promote this vision.</p>

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">The Outer Space Treaty (OST) came into shape in 1967, in a decade sprawling one of the most challenging endeavor of landing the first humans on the Moon. It provided a new legal framework for competing nuclear superpowers of the time, defining core principles for the safe and peaceful use of outer space. By separating the governance of the Moon and other celestial bodies from State interests, the Treaty adequately ensured to not compromise the benefits of space exploration for all of mankind. Now that it is gearing up for its 50th anniversary, a new call for action to revise or supplement the Treaty has been put into consideration. The inability for the OST to clearly define resolutions to the challenges and conflicting interests of today’s modern world has given rise to adapt the framework for the next space generation.</p>

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">
                                        The International Space Station (ISS) is the most complex technical endeavour that humanity has ever undertaken. Maintaining such a complex structure required new techniques and technologies. One of the technologies that’s been used with immense success has been space robotics. The Mobile Servicing System (MSS) has been used not only to assemble the ISS but is now being increasingly used to maintain the aging ISS.<br>
                                        Over the years, more and more tasks that would originally have been done via Extravehicular Activities (EVAs) are now being performed using ISS robotics systems. This growing experience base has allowed the ISS program to be both more efficient and to push the envelope of what can be accomplished robotically. Nowadays, all but a very small number of ISS robotic operations are commanded by personnel on the ground. Flight controllers on the ground perform the planning and execution of these operations.

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">At the time air and space law regimes have been conceived, in the XXth Century, the prospective of future activities embracing both regimes was not given much thought. However, today, the evolution of technology and the increase of commercial aviation and spatial activities, and mostly the arising of hybrid activities, have made the lack of uniformity and interaction between air and space law regimes worthy of attention. Particularly, future commercial activities such as suborbital flights will take place in both air space and outer space, making the choice of which legal regime to follow unclear and, thus, we are assisting to different solutions on this problem adopted by some space faring -but also non faring- nations, which are supported by divergent political positions. This situation is further complicated by the lack of a legal demarcation line between the air and the space.The study has the scope to explore the different legal solutions to this issue and the possibility for ICAO to incorporate suborbital flights in its regulatory regime.</p>

                                    <p class="presentation-abstract">
                                        This short presentation explores the social and political aspects of the migration of humans into space (also referred to as space colonization). Specifically, it focuses on some of the challenges of political organization, economy, and ethics beyond planet Earth. How will extraterrestrial environments affect the ethics and guiding principles of current societies? Does the prospect of permanent migration into space herald a transition to a post-human world?<br>
                                        In this presentation I point out some ethical and political challenges of migration (or colonization) that stem not just from the radical differences between our home planet and space environments, but also from our inability to anticipate the effects of fundamental aspects of space migration. For example: how would the scarcity of air and water affect political organization? How might different political arrangements (capitalistic, communitarian, autocratic) arise from organizational and economic premises in the early stages of space exploration?<br>
                                        Long duration space mission experiments, as well as literary imagination (from SF author such as Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, among other author), provide some of the food for thought used in this presentation. It aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the ethics of space exploration and the challenges of developing a new way of being for humans outside our home planet.

                                        Policy makers in education now emphasize the importance of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This change has opened up a lot of opportunities to develop curriculum on the thrilling science of Mars exploration. In this presentation I explain how my experiences teaching 3D games programming to high school students can and should be adapted to learn science through a virtual Martian environment.<br>
                                        This talk presents "Martian Agora", a 3D Mars game I developed to help with science instruction. The game uses real Mars terrain data and engineering concepts from Mars Society publications. Students learn science concepts while exploring how this game is built. Concepts like: gases, pressures, humidity, composition, radiation, coordinate systems, energy storage, energy production, gravity, and much more.

We, the Educational Outreach division of the McGill Space Systems Group, aim to attune Earth's inhabitants to the wonders of space. Since our group's liftoff, we have connected with over 300 young minds ranging from 6 to 17 years of age. We have covered various topics including gravity, the solar system, and the importance of satellite research. <br>
                                        Through executing our mission, we have witnessed that space-related topics are not the easiest to comprehend, given their abstract nature. It is therefore imperative to value pedagogical approaches, and their improvement, as much as the content we wish to teach. We are going to share with you the approaches we have used as well as teaching philosophies that teachers can adopt to encourage any individual's contribution to humanity's advancements in space. </p>

                                        <p class="presentation-abstract">CHIME is a new radio telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) near Penticton, British Columbia that will tackle several major questions in cosmology and astrophysics.  The telescope will make a three dimensional map of the distant universe that will be used to probe the fundamental nature of dark energy -- the mysterious agent invoked to explain the acclerating expansion of the universe.  It will also perform a survey for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) -- bright pulses of radio emission arriving in random directions from unknown sources well beyond our galaxy.  Finally, it will precisely measure the arrival time of radio pulses from known pulsars in an effort to detect ripples in the fabric of space and time due to gravitational waves.  CHIME was made possible by using market-driven commercial technologies in innovative ways.  In this talk, I will give an overview of the instrument and describe exactly how it will address these exciting science topics.</p>

Subsequent successes include robotic contributions to the Space Shuttle and International Space Station, satellite missions such as SCISAT-1 and CASSIOPE, and a high-profile astronaut corps that recent welcomed its two newest members. Next year, Canada looks forward to the launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission and the six-month ISS expedition of David Saint-Jacques. Beyond 2018, the Canadian space program is at a crossroads, awaiting a new space strategy and follow-on space plan to provide the policies and funding needed to grow our space capabilities in the years ahead.</p>

                                        <p class="bio">Joining the military in 1989 as a Communications and Electronics Engineering (CELE) Officer, Major Reyes has over twenty-seven years of experience as a military officer in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), with assignments around the world and throughout Canada. Her various experiences have given her a sound knowledge of space and space-related systems, operational requirements, security, and communications. She has been involved in all aspects of management throughout her career. Utilizing her knowledge of remote sensing and space systems, some of her previous assignments include working at the Canadian Space Agency on the RADARSAT Constellation Mission satellites, Director General Space in satellite communications, 8 Wing Air Communication and Control Squadron for mobile airfield communications, the North Warning System Office on the northern coastal radars, 12th Space Warning Squadron Greenland working with the United States Air Force, North American Aerospace Defence (NORAD) Headquarters (Colorado) in strategic missile warning, and Kandahar Air Field (Afghanistan) as Deputy Chief Communication Operations.<br><br>
                                        Major Reyes was recently named the Associate Centre Director at the Ottawa Research Centre of Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC). DRDC Ottawa specializes in research related to Electronic Warfare, cyber operations, space operations, and radar. Formally the Group Leader for Space Systems and Operations at DRDC Ottawa, her team was developing Space Situational Awareness and Space Mission Assurance for the Canadian military by studying ways to provide a picture of space events and space asset status for decision-makers, characterize the space environment and potential threats, improve methods for classifying these threats, and studying ways to protect space systems of national interest through effective assessment methodologies, the analysis of space system architectures, and their associated risks, vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies. A satellite that was jointly developed by DRDC Ottawa and the Canadian Space Agency was launched in 2016 from India and Maj Reyes has the chief administrative responsibilities to complete its implementation requirements.<br><br>
                                        Major Reyes received her Master of Sciences Degree from the University of Colorado, specializing in Remote Sensing. In 2012, she completed the International Space University Space Studies Program, a prestigious civilian, international and interdisciplinary course which teaches students space-related topics in seven disciplines. She has co-authored articles that have been published in international, scientific and space journals and continues to act as a scientific reviewer for international journals. Wanting to promote the positive influence of diversity and different cultures, Major Reyes was a member of the Visible Minority Advisory Group at the Canadian Space Agency and is still a member of the Defence Visible Minority Group based out of National Defence Headquarters. She is honoured to be a part of the Canadian Armed Forces Outreach Programme, promoting military careers for women and diverse cultures. <br><br>
                                        An avid dragon boater and squash player, Major Reyes won three gold medals at the 2016 Club Crew World Championships in Australia and most recently a gold medal at the Canadian National Championships 2017 as a member of an Ottawa women’s dragon boat team (civilian), has won the Canadian Forces National Squash Championships (Female Category) three times and was a member of the Canadian Forces Squash Team at five Canadian Interprovincial Squash Team Championships. In Winnipeg, Major Reyes coached her female (civilian) dragon boat team to four undefeated seasons. She voluntarily coaches squash players at her local Ottawa squash club. She was Canadian Forces Vice Chief of Defence Staff Female Athlete of the Year 2007. Major Reyes plays classical piano and flute, is learning to play the cello and Japanese Taiko drums, and sings in a local women’s choir.
